#Ninko 
Ninko is a PIN tool created to aid in instrumenting obfuscated code. It works by logging only calls and writes specified for an exact range. This helps in limiting the amount of information you need to wade through to understand how a binary may or may not be working.

#Usage
Ninko works off of JSON based configuration files.
